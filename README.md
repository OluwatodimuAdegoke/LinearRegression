# Linear Regression in Python with Keras and Android Studio (Kotlin)

This project showcases the implementation of linear regression using Python and the Keras library, and demonstrates how to integrate this model into an Android Studio project using Kotlin. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. 

## Project Overview

Linear regression is a widely used statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation. This project offers a comprehensive illustration of how to create, train, and deploy a linear regression model for a real-world use case. Here's an in-depth overview of what this project encompasses:

- **Python Implementation with Keras:**
  - We employ Python and Keras, a high-level neural networks API, to create and train a linear regression model. This model is capable of making predictions based on input data.

- **Sample Dataset:**
  - To train our model, we use a sample dataset that contains historical data of input features and corresponding target values. This dataset represents the basis for the model to learn and make predictions.

- **Android Studio Integration (Kotlin):**
  - The project goes a step further by illustrating how to integrate the trained linear regression model into an Android application developed in Kotlin using Android Studio. This enables the model to be used for making predictions directly from the Android app.

- **Real-World Applications:**
  - Linear regression has a wide range of real-world applications, from predicting housing prices based on features like square footage and number of bedrooms to forecasting sales based on advertising expenditure. This project lays the foundation for building such applications with machine learning.
